# fridge-cleaner
python program that allows you to keep inventory of your fridge, challenges you to make something based on what is in your fridge, and recommends recipes that you could make to get rid of the ingredients that are expiring soon! 

program has three modes: entry, challenge, and computer. entry mode enables you to log the items you get (you have the option of manually logging information about the item like 'date purchased' and 'approximate expiration' or having the computer log default information). challenge mode lets the computer randomly select 1-3 ingredients in your fridge and challenge you to make something with those ingredients. computer mode chooses ingredients in the fridge based on how close the expiration date is approaching.

there are two json files that are created- the 'ingredients' and the 'meals' files because entries like leftovers and prepackaged meals are different from ingredients. 

this is my first complex project! please let me know what i can improve on as i would love to get some feedback.

here are some ideas i have to improve the program moving forward: 1) make the program available on a gui or website 2) have a more accurate mechanism to autofill default values 3) have recipe recommendations from more than one site 4) allow user to store recipes of foods they can and like to make 5) give the user an option to pick a new recipe or familiar recipe
